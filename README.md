## Square lattice Fermionic/Bosonic iPEPS code based on TensorKit.jl.

The Fermionic sign is attracted through swap gates.

We provide:
1. Simple Update (Nearest-Neghbor / Next-Nearest-Neighbor interations)
1. Fast Full Update (Nearest-Neghbor interactions)
1. CTMRG
1. Observables (1-site and 2-site operators)

One can customize the LocalSpace following the style of [FiniteMPS.jl](https://github.com/Qiaoyi-Li/FiniteMPS.jl)
